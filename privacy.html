<h1>Privacy Policy – Wilmer App</h1>
<p>Last updated: August 13, 2025</p>

<p>Wilmer App (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides tools that read publicly available Instagram content from Business/Creator accounts and, with the user’s authorization, publish content to the user’s connected accounts.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account information you provide:</strong> name, email, and tokens granted through Meta to access your own Instagram Business/Creator account and connected Facebook Page.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Instagram data:</strong> public media metadata (e.g., media ID, caption, permalink, timestamp, media type) for specified public accounts.</li>
  <li><strong>Operational logs:</strong> timestamps of API calls, errors, and basic diagnostics to maintain service reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To detect newly published public media for automation workflows you configure.</li>
  <li>To publish media to accounts you have authorized.</li>
  <li>To comply with platform policies and applicable laws.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell personal data. We may share data with service providers strictly to operate the service (e.g., hosting/storage) under confidentiality obligations, or as required by law.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>Access tokens and logs are retained only as long as necessary to provide the service or as required by law. You may request deletion at any time (see “Data Deletion”).</p>

<h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
